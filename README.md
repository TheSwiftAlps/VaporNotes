# Vapor Notes API

This repository contains a sample implementation of a Notes taking app API, written in Vapor 2.0 and using a SQLite file database as storage.

It was created as part of the Vapor workshop in [Swift Alps 2017](https://theswiftalps.com/).

You can run an instance of this application and use the [Validator](https://github.com/TheSwiftAlps/Validator) application to verify each of its features.
